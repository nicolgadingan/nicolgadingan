- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicol.
- 👀 I’m interested in any type of development especially something that is personally doable and benefits me at some point.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel. I've created this app for a local retailer using just the basic of Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL) and currently converting it Laravel for neater package and additional features.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on at least a small group of folks for now. I am currently full-time employed and just doing my learning and development outside work.
- 📫 How to reach me at:
        Email:    nicolgadingan@gmail.com
        LinkedIn: nicolgadingan
